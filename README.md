### 💻 Technology Stack & Architectural Depth

The project utilizes Java, specifically focusing on advanced concepts to manage dynamic data, ensure responsiveness, and support diverse user interactions.

| Feature | Advanced Java Concept/Technology | Implementation Detail & Benefit |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Data Structure & Safety** | Collections & Generics | Utilizes collections (e.g., `ArrayList`, `HashMap`) for efficient data storage/retrieval. **Generics** ensure **type safety** across patient records, doctor lists, and appointment schedules. |
| **Concurrency & Performance** | Multithreading & Synchronization | **Multithreading** handles concurrent user requests for smooth performance. **Synchronization** prevents data corruption in shared resources like the appointment booking system. |
| **Database Connectivity** | JDBC Implementation | The standard **JDBC API** is used to establish reliable database connections, execute complex queries, and manage transactions. |
| **Security & Integrity** | Secure Data Access (Parameterized Queries) | **Parameterized queries** are employed extensively to prevent **SQL injection**, safeguarding data integrity and user information. |
| **Scalability** | Microservices Architecture | Developed using a **microservices architecture** with cloud-based scaling and optimized scheduling algorithms. |
| **Real-time Communication** | WebRTC Integration | Integrated **WebRTC** for reliable, stable video/chat functionality with minimal latency. |
